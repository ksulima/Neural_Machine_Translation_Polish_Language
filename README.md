# Unsupervised methods to NLP Polish language

## Introduction


This project is dedicated to unsupervised methods of text data transformation. The representation of text in such transformed form is inherent part of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and allows to consume unstructured data by various deep learning algorithms.

If NLP is a new term for you and sounds a bit mysterious, Yoav Goldberg in his [book](https://www.amazon.com/Language-Processing-Synthesis-Lectures-Technologies/dp/1627052984) describes it as:

>_Natural language processing (NLP) is a collective term referring to automatic computational processing of human languages. This includes both algorithms that take human-produced text as input, and algorithms that produce natural looking text as outputs._

NLP embraces wide range of tasks e.g. Named entity recognition, Sentiment analysis, Automatic summarization, Natural language generation and many more. Each one is a subject for separate project and could be thoroughly studied. 


I choose to analyze polish language, which is intentional and I explain below. Nevertheless used methods can be apply to any language and text data.
